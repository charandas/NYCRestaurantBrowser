# NYC Restaurant Browser #

This application should allow browsing and searching for restaurants within the following boroughs: Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan. And Queens.  You can get a sample data set from either Yelp or FourSquare APIs. At least 10 items per borough is sufficient.

## Rules: ##
1. Must be a responsive design.
2. Restaurants should be displayed in a tile list view of restaurants in a 4x5 grid of logos/images with paging. Tiles should contain restaurant name, cuisine and borough.
3. Must have filter controls to filter by borough, cuisine, and name search 
4. Clicking a tile should show a details view of the restaurant with full address and a map.
5. Demonstrate knowledge of unit testing
6. Support execution of unit tests and jslint via Grunt

## Architecture: ##
The front end should be a single page application powered by a REST API. All tiers should have unit tests as necessary.
